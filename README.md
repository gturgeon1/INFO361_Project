# INFO361_Project
We will be creating UI prototypes for Halina's Piano Teaching System. Interactivity will be added later. 

We need to look into square for receiving payment and node.js for new student form submissions

All images go in "Images" folder
HTML file--> what the screen will say 
CSS file--> how it is styled (colors, layout)
JS file--> how it functions
